# Path Expression

This repository contains an implementation of an algorithm by Tarjan that efficiently computes path expressions based on a labeled graph.
A path expression is a regular expression describing all path between two nodes in the labeled graph.

The implementation is according to what is described in the paper:

[Fast Algorithms for Solving Path Problems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=322273)
